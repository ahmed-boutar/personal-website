The website is hosted using firebase at https://ahmedboutar.com

Since the project is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript, code can be run just by opening the html pages on a browser

If you want to set it up with firebase, change the value of the dictionary firebaseConfig found in index.html with your firebase account infomation.
